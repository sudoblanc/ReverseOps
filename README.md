# ReverseOps: Reversing Offensive Security to apply defense
Welcome to ReverseOps, a collaborative repository aimed at bridging the gap between offensive security techniques and defensive strategies. Here, we reference real-world offensive security labs—such as those from TryHackMe—and reverse-engineer them to build effective defenses.

By understanding the methods attackers use, such as password brute-forcing, privilege escalation, and lateral movement, we can craft better ways to protect our systems. Each section of this repository breaks down an offensive technique, provides hands-on examples, and offers step-by-step guidance on defending against these specific attacks.

This repository is a learning resource for security enthusiasts, professionals, and anyone interested in improving their cybersecurity skills. Let’s learn together, share knowledge, and help each other create a more secure digital world.
